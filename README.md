### Move further

This Solidity contract is a basic token system that allows the creation and destruction of tokens. It has three variables: tokenName, tokenSymbol, and totalSupply. The mintToken function is used to create new tokens, while the burnToken function is used to destroy existing tokens. The contract can be deployed and interacted with using Remix or a similar Solidity IDE.
